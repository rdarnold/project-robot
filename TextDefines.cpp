"The year is 20XX.  Six months ago, years after world peace was achieved in the "
"United Peace Summit of 20XY, a new threat surfaced.  A threat from afar. "
"An Alien threat.  In light of this threat, the world scrambled to assemble "
"its aging weapons of war, preparing to defend against a full scale invasion. "
"Little is yet known about the true nature of the Alien threat, but the data from "
"the brief skirmishes between the United and Alien forces clearly shows that current "
"United weapons systems are woefully inadequate.  Many new proposals are under "
"consideration by world leaders to address the Alien threat; some practical, others " 
"merely dreams of science fiction.  One such proposal, a cutting edge mobile weapons "
"platform, shows much promise but is still in its infancy.  The name of the system is " 
"Project Robot, a gigantic Robot with a human operator capable of fighting off the Aliens "
"on their own terms.  You have been assigned as its Chief Systems Engineer. "
"It is your responsibility to oversee the development, test, fielding, and maintenance "  
"of Project Robot, ensuring that the system meets its objectives in confronting " 
"the Alien threat. "
"Good luck, Systems Engineer.  The future of Earth depends upon you!";


char *FirstTaskText = 
"As the Chief Systems Engineer of Project Robot, you must first gather "
"information so that you can determine the requirements of the system.  To do this, "
"you will have an opportunity to speak with stakeholder reprentatives about the "
"system needs and operating environment. Any information gained during this session "
"may be accessed at any time throughout the game by using the Ask button in the Overview screen. Additionally, "
"the known stakeholder needs regarding attacks, defenses, and system parameters can be viewed in "
"chart format by using the Info button. You "
"only have a limited number of questions that you may ask of the stakeholders; this limit "
"is analagous to the real world time and resource constraints that any project is restricted by, "
"so use your questions wisely.  Questions may also be repeated to gain additional information. ";

char *BasicFrameText = 
"- This model is the most versatile of the Robot model choices.  It is the most cost-efficient "
"in terms of changing designs and accommodating all possibilities.  It has no restrictions, nor " 
"does it have any specific strengths. ";

char *BattleFrameText = 
"- The Battle Frame is a fast, maneuverable platform that has performed well under some limited "
"test conditions.  As a base model it shows improved cost efficiency in maneuver and speed-related " 
"designs, however it has many restrictions and inefficiencies in other areas. ";

char *GunFrameText = 
"- The Gun Frame was the original deviation from the Basic Frame model.  The base Gun Frame model " 
"has been tested and qualified for field use.  A squad of qualified Gun Frames was pitted against " 
"the first Alien reconnaissance strike several months ago - the frames were completely annihilated. "  
"However, many stakeholders believe that with some significant modifications, " 
"the Gun Frame base model could still be a viable design against the Alien threat.  Gun Frames show " 
"increased cost efficiency in ranged weapons systems, but have inefficiencies in their defense " 
"systems and in their human interfaces. ";

char *HeavyFrameText = 
"- The Heavy Frame is the heaviest available Robot model, designed as an anti-tank and anti-heavy-gun Robot. "  
"It has increased cost efficiencies when paired with many different armor types and has cost efficiencies " 
"associated with its ability to withstand heavy firepower, but it suffers from inefficiencies in maneuverability, " 
"speed, and cooling, and is incompatible with some available technologies. ";

char *TankFrameText = 
"- The Tank Frame is a hybrid model between a Robot and a track vehicle.  The brainchild of a famous scientist, " 
"the Tank Frame model is unproven and untested, but shows potential in certain areas of maneuverability and removes " 
"many of the issues of Robotic legs.  Unfortunately without legs it is unable to jump, and loses the ability "
"to accommodate a number of other systems. ";

"comes at a sacrifice to speed and maneuverability, however.";
